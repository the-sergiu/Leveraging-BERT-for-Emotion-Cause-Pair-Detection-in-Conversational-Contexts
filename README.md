# Leveraging BERT for Emotion-Cause Pair Detection within Conversational Contexts

In the rapidly evolving field of Natural Lan- guage Processing (NLP), understanding the nuances of human emotion in text, particu- larly in dialogues, poses a significant chal- lenge. This paper introduces a novel approach to two critical subtasks in NLP: multiclass sen- timent analysis and emotion-cause pair detec- tion. We first develop an advanced sentiment analysis model capable of discerning multiple emotional states from textual data. Building on this foundation, we then address the more complex task of emotion-cause pair detection in dialogues. For this, we leverage the capa- bilities of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Rep- resentations from Transformers) in Next Sen- tence Prediction (NSP), adapting it to identify causal relationships between emotional expres- sions and their triggers within conversations. Our methodology is applied to the Friends Con- versation dataset, a rich source of colloquial and emotional dialogues. Through this appli- cation, we demonstrate how BERTâ€™s NSP fea- ture, primarily used for predicting sentence se- quences, can be innovatively adapted for detect- ing emotion-cause pairs in dialogue.
