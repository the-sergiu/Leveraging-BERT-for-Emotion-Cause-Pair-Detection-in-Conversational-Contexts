# Leveraging BERT for Emotion-Cause Pair Detection within Conversational Contexts

In the rapidly evolving field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), understanding the nuances of human emotion in text, particularly in dialogues, poses a significant challenge. This paper introduces a novel approach to two critical subtasks in NLP: multiclass sentiment analysis and emotion-cause pair detection. We first develop an advanced sentiment analysis model capable of discerning multiple emotional states from textual data. Building on this foundation, we then address the more complex task of emotion-cause pair detection in dialogues. For this, we leverage the capabilities of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) in Next Sentence Prediction (NSP), adapting it to identify causal relationships between emotional expressions and their triggers within conversations. Our methodology is applied to the Friends Conversation dataset, a rich source of colloquial and emotional dialogues. Through this application, we demonstrate how BERTâ€™s NSP feature, primarily used for predicting sentence sequences, can be innovatively adapted for detecting emotion-cause pairs in dialogue.
